***Original_Data Sheet***
Contains the Original Data provide along with the formating done based on the following instructions:
Using the Excel table provided, modify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some market trends.

Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, or canceled, or is currently live.

Create a new column O called Percent Funded that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made to reach its initial goal.
Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and blue at 200.

Create a new column P called Average Donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.

Create two new columns, one called Category at Q and another called Sub-Category at R, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.

Create a new column named Date Created Conversion that will use this formula to convert the data contained within launched_at into Excel's date format.

Create a new column named Date Ended Conversion that will use this formula to convert the data contained within deadline into Excel's date format.

Using the COUNTIFS() formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges listed above. Populate the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns with this data.

Add up each of the values in the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns to populate the Total Projects column. Then, using a mathematical formula, find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.
